    <p>I have several years of experience in customer service and event planning. I am getting into Web Development because it is interesting and fun. So far, I have only gotten through HTML, which is pretty fun, but we will see if I can keep it up as I continue on.</p>
    <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I enjoy reading, writing, and I have actually taken up editing for other people as well. Most recently I fully edited a play, and I hope to get more opportunities to edit. I love to travel, and I particularly enjoy historic locations and learning about the past.</p>
